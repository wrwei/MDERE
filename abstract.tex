Assurance cases are used to demonstrate confidence in properties of interest for a system, e.g. for safety or security. Typically, the task of constructing assurance cases is a lengthy and informal process. In recent years, there has been work to propose model based approaches to promote automation. The Structured Assurance Case Metamodel (SACM) is an OMG specification designed to represent system assurances in machine-readable models, so that a series of model management operations can be 
performed to automate the process of system assurance acceptance. However, the adoption of SACM faces difficulties as there is a cognitive gap between the syntax/semantics of SACM elements and the understanding of SACM in the perspective of system assurance practitioners.

In this paper, we provide a definitive guide to SACM with examples so that SACM can be better understood. We also discuss the relationship between SACM and the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) and the interoperability between them. We also propose a systematic approach for model based system assurance using SACM, so that all corresponding models can be bridged together using the facilities provided in SACM.
